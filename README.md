4. proximity to coastlines
5. boolean - is in tornado valley?

Assumptions:

1. All places have the same level of climate infrastructure EXCEPT the following: 


Will be using Random Forest Refgressor to produce continuous safeness values, and to develop non-discrete location data. 

Will connect it to heatmap with cartopy.

See resources.txt for data.
